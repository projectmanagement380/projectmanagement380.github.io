                   <p id="books_one_intro">From the multimillion-copy bestselling author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People—hailed as the
                       #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century—The 3rd Alternative turns Dr. Stephen
                       R. Covey’s formidable insight to a powerful new way to resolve professional and personal difficulties
                       and create solutions to great challenges in organizations and society.
                       <br>

                       <br>There are many methods of “conflict resolution,” but most involve compromise, a low-level accommodation
                       that stops the fight without breaking through to amazing new results. The 3rd Alternative introduces
                       a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving, transcending traditional
                       solutions to conflict by forging a path toward a third option, a 3rd Alternative that moves beyond
                       your way or my way to a higher and better way—one that allows both parties to emerge from debate
                       or even heated conflict in a far better place than either had envisioned. With the 3rd Alternative,
                       nobody has to give up anything, and everyone wins.

                   <p id="books_two_intro">Why is it so hard for managers to get the results they want? According to the latest brain science, it's
                       because most of what they do produces the opposite of what they expect. Appeals to reason fall short,
                       for our decisions are made emotionally, and logic is at best an after-the-fact justification for
                       what we've already determined to do.
                       <br>

                       <br>That's just one of the many amazing discoveries that explain why management is so challenging. but
                       as Charles Jacobs explains, once we understand the lessons of neuroscience, we're able to create
                       more powerful strategies, inspire people to maximize their potential, and overcome the biggest hurdle
                       to improving business performance-making change stick.

                   <p id="books_three_intro">In the updated edition of this critically acclaimed and bestselling book, Microsoft project veteran Scott
                       Berkun offers a collection of essays on field-tested philosophies and strategies for defining, leading,
                       and managing projects. Each essay distills complex concepts and challenges into practical nuggets
                       of useful advice, and the new edition now adds more value for leaders and managers of projects everywhere.
                       Based on his nine years of experience as a program manager for Internet Explorer and lead program
                       manager for Windows and MSN, Berkun explains to technical and non-technical readers alike what it
                       takes to get through a large software or web development project. Making Things Happen doesn't cite
                       specific methods, but focuses on philosophy and strategy. Unlike other project management books,
                       Berkun offers personal essays in a comfortable style and easy tone that emulate the relationship
                       of a wise project manager who gives good, entertaining and passionate advice to those who ask.
