                    <p id="book_one_intro">From the multimillion-copy bestselling author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People—hailed as the #1 Most Influential Business Book of the Twentieth Century—The 3rd Alternative turns Dr. Stephen R. Covey’s formidable insight to a powerful new way to resolve professional and personal difficulties and create solutions to great challenges in organizations and society.
                        <br>

                        <br>There are many methods of “conflict resolution,” but most involve compromise, a low-level accommodation that stops the fight without breaking through to amazing new results. The 3rd Alternative introduces a breakthrough approach to conflict resolution and creative problem solving, transcending traditional solutions to conflict by forging a path toward a third option, a 3rd Alternative that moves beyond your way or my way to a higher and better way—one that allows both parties to emerge from debate or even heated conflict in a far better place than either had envisioned. With the 3rd Alternative, nobody has to give up anything, and everyone wins.

                    <p id="book_two_intro">Why is it so hard for managers to get the results they want? According to the latest brain science, it's because most of what they do produces the opposite of what they expect. Appeals to reason fall short, for our decisions are made emotionally, and logic is at best an after-the-fact justification for what we've already determined to do.
                        <br>

                        <br>That's just one of the many amazing discoveries that explain why management is so challenging. but as Charles Jacobs explains, once we understand the lessons of neuroscience, we're able to create more powerful strategies, inspire people to maximize their potential, and overcome the biggest hurdle to improving business performance-making change stick.

                    <p id="book_three_intro">In the updated edition of this critically acclaimed and bestselling book, Microsoft project veteran Scott Berkun offers a collection of essays on field-tested philosophies and strategies for defining, leading, and managing projects. Each essay distills complex concepts and challenges into practical nuggets of useful advice, and the new edition now adds more value for leaders and managers of projects everywhere. Based on his nine years of experience as a program manager for Internet Explorer and lead program manager for Windows and MSN, Berkun explains to technical and non-technical readers alike what it takes to get through a large software or web development project. Making Things Happen doesn't cite specific methods, but focuses on philosophy and strategy. Unlike other project management books, Berkun offers personal essays in a comfortable style and easy tone that emulate the relationship of a wise project manager who gives good, entertaining and passionate advice to those who ask.

                    <p id="book_four_intro">This is a guide to agile methodologies. Most of the book is written in the context of software development, but it claims to apply to other fields. Unlike many books that detail how projects should be done, it focuses on how to think about project management, how to understand and design methods, and how to adapt to change.
                        <br>

                        <br>ASD:CG is one of the best books written on project management and is suitable for both beginners and experts. It gives readers the resources to learn more, and was also useful in the development of this website. (Note that this website only touches some of the surfaces of project management and is not meant to replace continued study.)
                        <br>
                        <br>The author occasionally acknowledges where he is lacking in experience or knowledge and the book includes topics that are under development. This is one of its strengths. Cockburn uses “Shu-Ha-Ri” from aikido as a principle for development and learning. Beginners of any discipline will likely start with techniques and work to higher level thinking about the principles. The first chapters are abstract and the latter ones are more concrete. Each chapter sufficiently explains itself, which means that the reader may explore the book in a customized sequence.
